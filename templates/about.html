        <h2>I learned at Founders and Coders</h2>
        <p>
          I was part of FAC's Winter 2019 cohort (FAC18). As well as being a
          supportive environment and network to learn web development, FAC
          promoted the value of open-source, tech for good and agile
          development.

        <h2>I've spent the pandemic working on social impact projects.</h2>
        <p>
          Spurred on by enthusiasm for FAC's 'Tech for Better' programme, on
          graduation I teamed up with fellow FAC18 cohort member Bethany Scott
          with the aim of working on socially motivated projects. This saw us work with a number of non-profit
          organisations and charities on projects ranging from web development
          to digital service design and product management learning programmes - often in partnership with CAST and the Catalyst network.

        <h2>I've been learning Go in my spare time</h2>
        <p>
          I've wanted to add a new language beyond Javascript to my skillset for
          a while. I chose Go for a number of reasons, and have enjoyed getting
          to grips with new syntax and tooling. This site is my first full Go
          project (you can see the repo
          <a

        <h2>I'm looking for a full-time dev role</h2>
        <p>
          I want to improve my understanding of proper dev team and staging
          dynamics that are not as easy to come by as a freelancer on small
          contracts. I'm looking for experience of working with with a larger
          production codebase in a mentoring environment...

        <h2>I previously worked in visual art</h2>
        <p>
          Before joining FAC I worked in various gallery and creative roles in
          visual art for over ten years. I have a degree in Environemntal art
          from Glasgow School of Art, and my last arts role was as Exhibitions
          Manager for a non-profit gallery specialising in Japanese contemporary
          art.
